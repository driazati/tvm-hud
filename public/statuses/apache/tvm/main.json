    "body": "* [Relax] Refactor RealizeVDevice to remove in-place mutation\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, the `relax.transform.RealizeVDevice` pass\r\nperformed in-place update on expressions appearing in its input\r\n`IRModule`, overwriting their struct info.  In-place mutation of TVM's\r\nIR types is only legal when the scope has sole ownership of the IR\r\nobject, such as through the `CopyOnWrite` functionality, and is not\r\nallowed when the object is shared.  As a result, applying\r\n`RealizeVDevice` would cause unexpected updates in unrelated\r\nexpressions.  Most noticeably, the `IRModule` used as input to\r\n`RealizeVDevice` would have its variable erroneously updated.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors the `RealizeVDevice` transform to remove all\r\nin-place mutation.  The same propagation rules are followed, with\r\nknown `VDevice` annotations propagated forward from the output of\r\n`R.hint_on_device`, and propagated backwards from the input of\r\n`R.hint_on_device` if no such annotation already exists.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/17205.\r\n\r\n* lint fixes",

This ignored use cases where a tuple is used as an aggregate\r\nobject, such as returning a tuple from a function.  This would collect\r\nincorrect results for a Relax function that calls a subroutine,\r\nreceives a tuple as the return value of the subroutine, then returns\r\nthat tuple.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `RemoveUnusedOutputs` to look for usage of a tuple\r\nobject, not just for usage in `TupleGetItem`.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/17247",

    "body": "Prior to this commit, the Relax well-formed checker validated\r\narguments provided to Relax functions, but did not validate arguments\r\nprovided to `R.call_tir`.  As a result, incorrect arguments from Relax\r\nto TIR would not be checked until runtime, if at all.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the well-formed checker to verify that\r\n`R.call_tir` has received the correct arguments, and has the correct\r\noutput shape specified in the `out_sinfo` parameter.\r\n\r\nInitial implementation performed the validation as part of\r\n`FNormalize`, to maximize coverage of this check.  This increased\r\nend-to-end compilation time by ~10%, and so the check was requested to\r\nbe restricted to the well-formed checker.  Expensive operator-specific\r\nvalidation is now performed in the new `FValidate` attribute.",

    "body": "* [CI][Hexagon] Forward gtest tests into pytest as separate tests\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, all Hexagon test cases in\r\n`tests/cpp-runtime/hexagon` were executed as part of a single unit\r\ntest in pytest.  This can take a significant portion of the total\r\ntimeout in CI (~50 minutes out of a 2-hour timeout).  While the\r\nhexagon tests are split out onto 8 separate runners, having a single\r\nlarge test can cause timeouts on whichever runner happens to receive\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis commit exposes each unit test from `tests/cpp-runtime/hexagon`\r\ninto a separate unit test in pytest, to avoid these timeouts.\r\n\r\n* lint fix",

Prior to this commit, if the\r\n`IRModule` already contained a function with that name, an error would\r\nbe raised.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, the `LiftTransformParams` pass will instead check\r\nfor existing functions, and compose the previous transformation\r\nfunction with the newly-lifted transformation.  This allows\r\n`LiftTransformParams` to be used alongside a hand-written parameter\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/17200",

    "body": "\u202617243)\n\n* [Relax] Avoid wrapping TupleStructInfo into a Tuple for R.call_tir\n\nPrior to this commit, the different `R.call_tir*` variations would\nwrap the arguments into an in-line `relax.Tuple`, if it is not\nalready a `relax.Tuple`.  While this allows a tensor to be passed into\nthese functions as a single argument (`R.call_tir(func, arg, ...)`\ninstead of `R.call_tir(func, [arg], ...)`), the wrapped Relax variable\nmay already refer to a tuple.\n\nThis use of a variable to refer to an argument tuple rather than an\nin-line argument tuple is not allowed by Relax.  (See discussion on\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15916 for details.)  However, by\nwrapping a variable `args: R.Tuple(R.Tensor, R.Tensor, ...)` into a\ntuple-of-tuples, the error occurs after the expression has already\nbeen generated, and refers to an expression `R.Tuple(R.Tuple(R.Tensor,\nR.Tensor, ...))` that doesn't appear anywhere in the user's input.\nThis can make debugging difficult (see\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/17239 for an example).\n\nThis commit updates the argument-handling in `R.call_tir` to only\ngenerate an in-line `relax.Tuple` if the arguments do not already have\n`relax.TupleStructInfo`.  If the argument was provided as a Relax\nvariable bound to a tuple of arguments, it will still produce an\nerror.  However, that error will occur much earlier, and will\nexplicitly state that the argument must be a `relax.Tuple` instead of\na `relax.Var`.\n\n* lint fixes",

The initial\r\nimplementation added both a new type code (`kTVMArgBool`) and a new\r\n`TVMValue::v_bool` variant.  This commit removes the\r\n`TVMValue::v_bool` variant, since the `kTVMArgBool` type code is\r\nsufficient to handle boolean arguments.\r\n\r\nRemoving the `TVMValue::v_bool` variant also makes all `TVMValue`\r\nvariants be 64-bit (assuming a 64-bit CPU).  This can simplify\r\ndebugging in some cases, since it prevents partial values from\r\ninactive variants from being present in memory.\r\n\r\n* Update MakePackedAPI, less special handling required for boolean",

    "headline": "[Cleanup] Remove `using namespace tvm::runtime` from headers (#17246)",
    "body": "Prior to this commit, various header files had `using namespace\r\ntvm::runtime`, which imports all names from `tvm::runtime` into the\r\ncurrent namespace.\r\n\r\nThese imports can cause compilation errors depending on the order of\r\n`#include` statements.  For example, the `#include\r\n<tvm/relay/attrs/transform.h>` file uses the unqualified name `Bool`\r\nto refer to `::tvm::Bool`, a subclass of `PrimExpr`.  If a different\r\nheader file specifies `using namespace tvm::runtime` within the\r\n`tvm::relay` namespace, then the unqualified name `Bool` ambiguously\r\nrefers to either `::tvm::Bool` or `::tvm::runtime::Bool`.\r\n\r\nIn MSVC, this can cause even further compilation errors.  By default,\r\nMSVC does not follow the C++ standard for name resolution in\r\ntemplates.  The standard requires that any names in a template that do\r\nnot depend on template parameters be resolved when the template is\r\ndeclared.  However, MSVC instead resolves these names when the\r\ntemplate is instantiated.  As a result, the same `using namespace\r\ntvm::runtime` may cause a compilation error if it occurs after the\r\ntemplate's declaration, but before the template's usage.\r\n\r\n(TVM provides the `/permissive-` flag to MSVC builds specifically to\r\ndisable MSVC's non-standard name resolution, so this only impacts\r\ndownstream forks that disable this flag.  See\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16343 for more details.)\r\n\r\nThis commit removes `using namespace tvm::runtime`, replacing them\r\nwith explicit `using tvm::runtime::SOME_SPECIFIC_SYMBOL` where\r\nnecessary.  This resolves both the include-order dependency for\r\nstandards-compliant compilers, and the compilation errors for MSVC's\r\ndefault build.",

    "body": "* [IR] Handle NaN in StructuralEqual and StructuralHash\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, `NaN` values did not have any special handling\r\nin either `StructuralEqual` or `StructuralHash`.\r\n\r\n`StructuralEqual` checked whether the LHS and RHS were within some\r\ntolerance of each other.  If the LHS and RHS are both `NaN`, this\r\nwould evaluate to false.  The updated `StructuralEqual` now checks for\r\nthis case, and returns true if both sides are `NaN`.\r\n\r\n`StructuralHash` used the bit-pattern of a floating-point number to\r\ncompute the hash.  A `NaN` value may have any non-zero value in its\r\nmantissa, and so this could produce distinct hashes for ASTs that\r\ndiffer only by the choice of non-zero value.  The updated\r\n`StructuralHash` uses the same\r\n`std::numeric_limits<double::quiet_NaN()` value for all `NaN` values.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, `StructuralEqual` and `StructuralHash` can now\r\ncompare two IR functions, even if they contain `NaN`.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/17247\r\n\r\n* lint fix",

This could occur when a model\r\ncontained a large number of calls to `\"vm.builtin.tuple_getitem\"`,\r\nwhich may occur when model weights are provided as a tuple.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-applies the changes from\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16183, but with the performance\r\ndegredation resolved.  The root cause was unnecessary type-checking\r\nwhen converting from an untyped `tvm::ArrayNode*` to the typed\r\n`tvm::Array<T>`, in the case where `T` is `ObjectRef`.\r\n\r\n* Correct typo from T to U",

    "body": "\u2026 R.view (#17145)\n\nPreviously, `R.view` was legalized to extern call to\r\n`runtime.TVMArrayCreateView` during `LegalizeOps`. This call to extern\r\nfunc can't be properly handled by `StaticBlockPlanMemory` because it\r\nassumes the extern func does not retain the input buffer. Extern func\r\nreturning a view of the input would break the ref count of the\r\nbuffer. This PR defers the legalization of `R.view` so that it can be\r\nexplicitly handled by memory planning.\r\n\r\nA new op `R.ensure_aligned` is added as discussed in #16955",

    "headline": "[FFI][RUNTIME] Introduce runtime boxed types for int/float/bool (#16183)",
    "body": "* [Container] Support non-nullable types in Array::Map\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, the `Array::Map` member function could only be\r\napplied to nullable object types.  This was due to the internal use of\r\n`U()` as the default value for initializing the output `ArrayNode`, where\r\n`U` is the return type of the mapping function.  This default\r\nconstructor is only available for nullable types, and would result in\r\na compile-time failure for non-nullable types.\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces `U()` with `ObjectRef()` in `Array::Map`,\r\nremoving this limitation.  Since all items in the output array are\r\noverwritten before returning to the calling scope, initializing the\r\noutput array with `ObjectRef()` does not violate type safety.\r\n\r\n* [FFI] Separate runtime types from IR types for int/float/bool\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, `int`, `float`, and `bool` arguments from Python\r\nwere converted to `IntImm`, `FloatImm`, and `Bool`.  These are\r\nsubtypes of `PrimExpr`, and should only be used at compile-time.  By\r\nautomatically applying this conversion as part of the FFI, these types\r\nare required to be present whenever a primitive is converted to a\r\n`tvm::ObjectRef`.\r\n\r\nThis can become especially fragile for an end-user when storing\r\nobjects into a TVM container.  Because TVM containers require all\r\ncontents to be `ObjectRef` subclasses, an automatic conversion may be\r\napplied on storing into a container, resulting in an unexpected type\r\nbeing retrieved from the container.  For example, this currently\r\noccurs in Relax when extracting a `R.Prim` from a `R.Tuple`.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a `Box<T>` type for storage of boxed primitives\r\nat runtime, distinct from the IR types.\r\n\r\n* Primitive arguments provided to a PackedFunc that requires an\r\n  `ObjectRef` will be converted to the corresponding boxed type.\r\n  (e.g. Passing a Python `int` to a C++ function accepting `ObjectRef`\r\n  produces a `Box<int64_t>`.\r\n\r\n* Boxed primitives provided to a PackedFunc that requires an unboxed\r\n  primitive will be converted to the corresponding primitive.\r\n\r\n* PackedFunc return values of `ObjectRef` are converted to the\r\n  corresponding primitive, if present.  (e.g. If a `tuple_getitem`\r\n  with static return type `ObjectRef` returns a `Box<int64_t>`, it\r\n  will be unwrapped to a python `int`.)\r\n\r\nTogether, these three rules provide backwards compatibility for\r\nexisting PackedFunc definitions, while avoiding exposing the user to\r\nany container-induced type conversions betweeen primitive types and\r\n`ObjectRef`.\r\n\r\n* Fix unit test failure after merge\r\n\r\n* Fix breakage in new unit test",

    "body": "Prior to this commit, the `tvm.relax.dpl.rewrite_bindings` utility\r\nwould segfault if its input contained a `DataflowBlock` whose first\r\nbinding was a `MatchCast`.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is use of an unintialized `const VarNode* cur_user_;`\r\nwhen collecting the variable usage.  This variable is only initialized\r\nfor `VarBinding` nodes, and may be used uninitialized if a `MatchCast`\r\nnode is encountered before the first `VarBinding`.  This uninitialized\r\nvalue is later dereferenced during while pattern-matching, causing a\r\nsegfault.\r\n\r\nThis commit provides a default value of `nullptr` for\r\n`MatcherUseDefAnalysis::cur_user_`, preventing the segfault.",

    "body": "Prior to this commit, the `image_exists` utility in\r\n`determine_docker_images.py` logged the full response for success, and\r\nthe full HTTP error if an exception is caught.  However, this is the\r\nexpected behavior when loading a docker image from `tlcpackstaging`,\r\nsuch as the current images tagged with `20240428-060115-0b09ed018`.\r\nLogging this fallback as an error makes it difficult to find the first\r\nactual error that occurred in CI.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates these logging statments `logging.info` and\r\n`logging.exception` to instead use `logging.debug`.",

Previously `TupleGetItem` is treated as `kInjective`,\r\nthis causes any operation that relies purely on these params to be\r\nmoved to the beginning of the function and increases the memory usage\r\nof the intermediate results.\r\n\r\n* lint",

    "body": "* Fix LWP assembly handler (predicate register) (#2216)\r\n\r\nThis solved the issue with LWP that appears with maxpool.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the LWP handler was forgetting to save p0 (used by the handler). This predicate register needs to be saved too, just like r0-r5, as it had been decided that it was the responsibility of the handler to save everything (even these theoretically caller-saved registers).\r\nSaid differently, since it had been decided that calling the LWP handler would not follow the normal ABI, and that the LWP handler would save everything it touches (even normally caller-saved registers like r0-r15 and p0-3), then it absolutely needs to save the predicate registers too (in particular p0, which was causing the issue).\r\n\r\nThe issue appeared only with maxpool because it's the only one that had a state saved in p0 before calling the LWP handler. And this call destroyed the content of what it had saved, making it subsequently branch to different portions of the code.\r\n\r\nFix: Allocate 32 bytes (instead of 24 previously), in order to save p3:0, and I save those at the bottom of the stack. Restore it at the end of the LWP handler.\r\n\r\n* Remove training spaces\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Slama, Franck <fslama@qti.qualcomm.com>",

In\r\nthis case an exception that operator `__del__` is not implemented will\r\nbe generated. To avoid this problem we need to declare `__del__`\r\nfunction for each property where we define operator `__set__`.\r\n\r\n* Apply comments\r\n\r\n* Set dref.handle to None instead of using __del__ functions",

    "headline": " [Relax] Implement Rewriter class for pattern-rewrite (#17149)",
    "body": "* [TVMScript][Bugfix] Normalize relax::If with function's TIR var\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, the branches of `relax::If` were normalized\r\nusing `EraseToWellDefinedInScope`, using a fresh variable scope.\r\nWhile this had the intended behavior of preventing variables defined\r\nin a single branch from being usable outside of the conditional, it\r\nalso caused the conditional's branches to treat function-scope\r\nsymbolic variables as if they were undefined.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `tvm::relax::Normalizer` so that `relax::If`\r\nis normalized within an inherited scope.  This preserves the previous\r\nbehavior for symbolic variables defined within a branch, but allows\r\nshapes within a branch to use symbolic variables defined outside of\r\nthe branch.\r\n\r\n* [Relax] Canonicalize known symbolic shapes in Relax expressions\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, known constants in Relax functions would be\r\ninlined by the `CanonicalizeBindings` pass, but only if they appeared as Relax\r\nexpressions (e.g. `R.const` or `R.prim_value`).  Known constants that\r\nappeared as TIR variables (e.g. symbolic shapes) would be kept as\r\ndynamic parameters, even if they were known at compile time.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `CanonicalizeBindings` pass to identify known\r\nvalues of symbolic shapes, and to use these known values in shape\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\n* [Relax][Refactor] Reorganize pattern-matching\r\n\r\nA follow-up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16730.  Now that the\r\nimplementations for `rewrite_call` and `rewrite_bindings` are in\r\nseparate classes, they can be further split out into separate files.\r\n\r\n* [Relax][Refactor] Implement Rewriter class for pattern-rewrite\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, the pattern to be matched and the rewrite to be\r\nperformed were provided as separate arguments.  This commit introduces\r\na new class `ExprRewriter`, which contains both parts.\r\n\r\nThis abstraction will make it easier to combine multiple different\r\nrewrite rules, applying them in a single pass.\r\n\r\n* lint fixes\r\n\r\n* Remove unnecessary change which broke a unit test\r\n\r\n* lint fix for import order\r\n\r\n* Add docstrings\r\n\r\n* lint fix\r\n\r\n* Lint fix\r\n\r\n* lint fixes\r\n\r\n* lint fix\r\n\r\n* Update based on review comments\r\n\r\n* Add test case for matching against arbitrary dtype\r\n\r\n* Fix breakage in unit tests\r\n\r\nOne unit test that had been relying on invalid shape propagation.\r\nAnother unit test that required constructed an ill-formed output to\r\ntest against.\r\n\r\n* Updated base class name from ExprRewriter to PatternMatchingRewriter\r\n\r\n* lint fix",

In some cases, despite not having an explicit rewrite rule in\r\n`RewriteSimplifier`, the `RewriteSimplifier::CanProve` function would\r\ncheck if `x-x` simplifies to zero, relying on the rewrite rules used\r\nfor `tir::Sub`.  However, the rule to rewrite `x-x` into zero was only\r\nenabled for `int32`, `int64`, and floating-point types, so relying on\r\nthis behavior was inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the rewrite rules for both `tir::EQ` and\r\n`tir::Sub` to check for simplification of `x-x` or `x==x`, regardless\r\nof the datatype.  This change preserves the fast-path for index\r\ndata-types, in which `int32` and `int64` expressions may be simplified\r\nwithout checking for side effects.  For all other dtypes, the\r\ncancellation only applies when evaluating `x` has no side effects.\r\n\r\n* Add comment about simplifications of NaN/Inf",
