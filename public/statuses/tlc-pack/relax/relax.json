This also mean that we can leverage the full runtime support\r\nto handle things like allocation, dynamic shape, easy plugins and python\r\ninteraction, which are not available in more limited runtime.\r\n\r\nThe user directly use the same API to load the generated code regardless\r\nof compiled mode or bytecode.
